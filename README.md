# ML-Workflow-in-Python
Motivation: The purpose of this repository is to make it easier for machine learning practioners to locate existing codes or libraries to perform common statistical learning techniques. I have gathered most of these codes from a variety of resources, with some adjustments to make it fit into the specific examples within. Where possible, I will do my best to cite the original authors and sources. I hope you will find this a useful reference.
